# About the Todd Group
We are a group of scientists interested in chemistry, biology and drug discovery. We can be found mostly at University College London in the School of Pharmacy, 29-39 Brunswick Square, London WC1N 1AX, UK. There are still some group members at Mat's previous institution, the University of Sydney, Australia.

In this repository you can find information about our research, our publications and news about us. There's another repository that details all the group members past and present. There's a further repository that deals with how the group works.
