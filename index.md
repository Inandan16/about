We are a group of scientists interested in chemistry, biology and drug discovery. We can be found mostly at University College London in the School of Pharmacy, 29-39 Brunswick Square, London WC1N 1AX, UK. There are still some group members at Mat's previous institution, The University of Sydney, Australia.
