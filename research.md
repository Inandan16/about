## First Open Source Science Project - Praziquantel as a Single Enantiomer

First project on PZQ was written up in an [article in Nature Chemistry](http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v3/n10/full/nchem.1149.html) that describes what we think open source science is.

The website where it all got started was [The Synaptic Leap](http://www.thesynapticleap.org/node/286) and all the work was described in [an online electronic lab notebook (ELN)](http://www.ourexperiment.org/racemic_pzq).

Early work was described in an [online ELN](http://malaria.ourexperiment.org/), as well as an associated [wiki](http://openwetware.org/wiki/Open_Source_Drug_Discovery_-_Malaria), [G+ page](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/114702323662314783325/114702323662314783325/posts) and [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/OSDDMalaria) all now old.

## Open Source Malaria

Mat founded the **Open Source Malaria (OSM) Consortium** ([Github](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria), [Landing Page](http://opensourcemalaria.org/#))

(A brief note on the Pied Piper role. Open source projects benefit from a coordinator, to guide, assimilate, reach out. This is often referred to as a [Pied Piper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin) role, but a _much_ better analogy is the [James Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Murray_(lexicographer)) role.)

## Open Source Tuberculosis
Mat founded the [Open Source Tuberculosis (OSTB) Consortium ](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_General_Start_Here) and there are currently three compound series.

**[OSTB Series 1](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_Series_1/wiki/What-is-OSTB-Series-1%3F)** - _The spiro series_

Many of the compounds in this series displayed high potency vs _M.tb_ but a significant risk of hERG inhibition and a lower-than-desired _in vivo_ tolerability combined lead us to park the series. The series was publish in [J. Med. Chem.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01533) in 2018 and all the [data](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_Series_1/wiki/Sources-of-Data) is available for anyone to pursue.


**[OSTB Series 2](https://openwetware.org/wiki/OpenSourceTB:OSTB_Series_2)** - _Imidazopyridines_

**OSTBS27** was identified by GSK in a high throughput screen. **OSTBS27** is active against both replicating _M.tb_ (MIC vs. H37Rv = 10 μM) and non-replicating TB (>50% inhibition in 10 experiments out of 13) with mean PXC50 of 5.2 μM. The project is currently available for anyone to pursue.

**[OSTB Series 3](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_Series_3/wiki)** - _Small molecule inhibitors of non-replicating M.tb_

**OSTBS83** was identified by GSK and Cornell University in [2015](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.5b00025)
as a selective inhibitor of non-replicating _M.tb_ (NR IC90 = 2.01 μM). This project is [active](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_Series_3) and to date [> 60 compounds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z2cjYPx4elBNuZOQjKd0Gn4aTQMz_W58dztc1uYSpZg/edit#gid=0) have been evaluated for activity against non-replicating M.tb, in a pursuit to develop a new drug for [latent tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/preventive-care/ltbi_faqs/en/).

_Contributions to this project are welcomed._

## Open Source Antibiotics

Mat is also part of the [Open Source Antibiotics](https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/GeneralTopics) (OSA) consortium which consists of researchers interested in open ways to discover and develop new, inexpensive medicines for bacterial infections. There are currently two series in the OSA consortium.

**[OSA Series 1](https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/murligase)** - _Mur ligases_

The focus is the discovery and development of new antibiotics, specifically inhibitors of the Mur ligase enzymes using a fragment based approach.

**[OSA Series 2](https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/Series-2-Diarylimidazoles)** - _Diarylimidazoles_

The focus is the discovery and development of new antibiotics, specifically the optimisation of a series of molecules discovered at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.

### Licences

There is no adequate licence to cover entire open source drug discovery projects. Open Source Malaria and others use the CC-BY licence. [Data should abide by the FAIR principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01720-7). [Linking those who generate data with the downstream use of that data](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01715-4) (for credit) might be desirable.
